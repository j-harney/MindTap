      <p>Welcome to my portfolio. My name is Jack Harney, and I am going to be a BS Computing graduate from the University of West Georgia. I hope you appreciate the skills I have curated up to this point, along with the achievements displayed next to them.</p>

      <p>My main mission is to improve now for the sake of tomorrow. If I stop improving, then I lose sight of the future workplace, future business practice, and future coding.That would make me substandard and a liability to my employer. I ensure that will not happen by studying and maintaining my skillsets throughout my life.</p>
